# ARCExpandingButtonsMenu
Built as an idea for a menu that expands and collapses, ARCExpandingButtonsMenu is a UIView that supports animating rounded buttons horizontally outwards (either right to left or vice versa), and back in. 

This is currrently working, and will be an ongoing effort. Use freely and at your own risk.
